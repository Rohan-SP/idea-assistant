Modular Charcuterie boards that have notches to place pedestals and can accommodate the use of leaves in the art or even leaves to be grabbed to use as plates
Since Charcuterie boards are going to be crowded right away its best to make plate combos that people can pick up from the side while the main Charcuterie board is picked at. Also the plate will be well liked and popular combos for those with dietary restrictions and not able to pick out what they want. The main Charcuterie board will be slow since it will be picked at with forks, tongs and other utensils, instead of with hands as that's disgusting and will be advised against
Corvus - It's a genus of birds. Names like these are good names, like other species' family names.
Making a keybind that will be used in blender to essentially make a timelapse of the sculpting that I do. How it will be done is that I will have cameras in the blender project that will be specifically set up strategically based on what parts of the sculpture I will be working on. Then as I make each little change I will then press a button that will snap to a specific angle and take a screenshot and then snap back. I can even just set one button that will snap all angles and save them to different folders in one button press.

Nike air Force, the fundraiser episode from the boondocks onto shoes paint the 4 characters Huey, Riley, Jazmine, Cindy.
It's possible to make wood cages with a bird in it but carving out a cage and in the inside carving a bird through the cage bars, this is cool since cuz it's like how did the bird get in and it's difficult to do, so you could use a 4d cnc milling machine to carve it and carve most of the bird away. This can also be done like pouring a bird in an epoxy mold and then demolding the bird in the the cage, this also gives possibilities like building a mold around the cage like an octopus in a cage made from epoxy in the cage but also hanging on to say a cliff or climbing or using it as armor
Using strontium aluminate in stuff like resin or paint since it is one of the best glow in the dark powder/substance

Ring where the head gem can spin the side gems (shoulder gems) and vice versa, by way of little gears through the pointy part that connects to the ring
Ring where the head gem spins but by way of a little nob at the opposite end, how this would work is either little gears run along the band across the curve or there's a little gear band along the inside of the ring band
Ring where the head gem spins through a little Alan wrench from the inside of the band where the finger touches
Ring where instead of the usual head and 2 shoulder gems it is one big gems and one smaller gem where there's a design between and around them sorta like for a women with one child and husband so the big gem is the husband and the smaller gem is the child, or even like older sibling and younger sibling

Making a drawer or cabinet or shelf that can open but when it opens a second time it reveals other stuff this can be toggled with a switch or its just how it works that when you open and close it, it switches, this can also be achieved by having a false wall and in the wall have a mini hallway where two rack sit on rails and then when the door is open it will open up to a cabinet of things and when a switch is activated the rack will move side to side revealing either one, how this will work is there will be space for 3 racks behind the wall but there will only be 2 racks behind the walls with a hole for one and the racks need to move side to side to be able to be accessed, maybe a thumbprint or passcode or a secret switch, it can be like one pass code opens it and another opens the access to the other safe. So basically it's both secret racks but while one is an open secret the other is a hidden secret right beside it unknown. Also can have a third option of it being a door to another room with a third passcode by having the shelves move to either side with a hole in the middle to another room

Make a string art of 23 and them some emojis of money bills with wings as a gift for yash
Holes for string art can be pre planned by using a cnc machine and then hit a nail through the hole but to control how deep it goes, put a 3 printed stopper slided it around the nail and below the head so the head can't hit past the stopper and then the stopper slides out once the nail is in the correct depth or height from the board surface
Handcuff ring or could be a set since pairs of hand cuffs basically small handcuffs for one finger
Using Japanese joinery style for putting table legs together but the joinery is in the center of the wood legs hidden and the side where the wood is connecting with another food is cnc'd with a design and stacked on top and stuff and designed in such a way that it is seamlessly putting multiple portraits alongside with each going circular and connecting other woods and stuff even multi-layer with joinery in the middle in the way like apple has their apple airport sealed in a way that can't be opened without breaking it apart

When making videos 2 things to ask for are for the people to subscribe and to share the videos. when subscribers are watching most is when you want the video to say to share the video as loyal subscribers will share.  When the subs have finished watching the videos and mostly random people are watching il ask for a sub especially when the views are higher then my subscriber count
D&D Board where its essentially a giant screen on a custom table where animated landscapes can be used for campaigning
When you get an ai art generator subscription it will be worth taking two random words or objects and having  ai generator combine the two like a bed and a bookshelf gave the idea of a murphy bed bookshelf where a reading chair comes out. These will need to work with a python word generator where it just spits out 2 random words and possibly in different contexts like spoon in a chair is different from a spoon chair which is different from spoon and a chair. Possible just giving all the contexts 
Bookshelf and a murphy bed that if you open a bookshelf a sitting chair comes out that you can sit and read in.
Custom suitcase that holds my laptop, laptop charger, thin duo tang folders, pencil case, wallet, keychain, possibly a water pouch, phone, charger, space for drawing tablet, maybe space for a over the chest fanny, space for a portable charger, might be a good idea to have it be modular like a case so it is modular and is in trays that way it can much easily be packed, possibly has a number for the amount of stuff it should hold for the day (like a number lock spoke wheel)
Custom cases for everything so that way I can pack it organized on a shelf and it has icons and specific sizes so it fits in like say a shelf or a tray or suitcase like a modular case and with icons on each specific case. Basically super organized and aesthetic and easy to understand also spacers so that its easier to pack tightly in stuff
Fire flower that is for dispelling gasoline and it will basically be like a head for a fire place where fire will come from
Some sort of laser art where it has a bunch of lasers’ and little mirror and basically how it works is you turn on the light and the laser hits all the laser making a design like a string art around nails expect it can be in any shape or form not a circle or square. This can also be digital and such that motors control the mirrors like a sisyphus table, with program able art displays
Laser wall where a single laser shoots across a wall and makes a pattern by being directed by mirrors. The mirrors can get fancy such that it will have stuff like a mirro type where it will send back the laser light but slight offset a center meter, possible mirror tubs to add time to the laser or just having digital time delay with a sensor to send the same signal through an output or having a gas or liquid that light travels very slow through so that the light can be stopped and shown to disappear but not all at once like like usually does 
Little wood boxes with epoxy cracks and and a light is shown through kinda giving it an led glow effect maybe even complicated such that it has like a delay but that would be requiring a computer or it can even be connected to a little pad it charges through and if you want instead of for charging it will send power but based on the power sent through it will not light up all the lights in the box and it can also have a pulse effect
Floating compass for pointing at wte depending on what its pointing at

Chandelier of fish, they could all be manta rays or random assorted and even sharks. Or sharks chasing a fish. And they can be glowing and held up by thin thin fishing wire. It could have a drawstring light switch in the shape of a fishing hook, so when you pull the hook the lights run on or off. The fishes can even just ben made from glass or clear epoxy with shiny powder in it, or even have a multiples molds with the fishes being made in pieces at a time and then that way their can be shiny powder (mica?) in each parts like the body of a shark could be black shiny powder and the fins and dorsals and tails can be gray shiny powder. Or eve just wood carvings although wood is the worst option, just cuz it would block light and be brown or if not brown would need to be painted.

Having a PC case where instead of an open box of the PC components it is like a piece of tech spread out but still connected to each other and functional against a white board and framed
Enamel pins
Making a surrey bike
For a stained glass artwork the steps are (1) cut glasses to proper sizes by first drawing on poster cutting shapes then pasting paper to glass then cutting out glass and sanding (2) arrange glass in order but upside down so the side that's gunna be showing is face down and then (3) put temporary caulk or silicone in between the spaced out stained glass and remove excess (4) pour epoxy resin in between the glass, maybe pour the epoxy with slight color added like a little black or any other color to contrast the specific piece
Frozen Mango molds that you put 200 Grams worth and it freezes into a puck or tablet shape and then it's easier to just grab a pre shaped tablet of frozen Mango instead of measuring each time can even be mangi shaped

River resin table but instead of a river design the wood on the surface can be carved in such a way to have a design from the outline like a mountain or wte and then once dried and cured gold foil or other layers can be added and then clear resin is added to sorta immortalize it.
Resin sculptures but it has gold foil on it, either partially or fully
Roti maker that will use a motor for the base plate and 2 individual pvc pipes as rollers that are on separate halves of the rod across the top of the base allowing the pipes to spin separately and the Roti will sit between 2 plastic sheets and a cool feature is that the rotating base will activate when the rolling pvc pipes are pulled down on the Roti ball housing should be made pretty and this can be a video for tortilla, pizza dough, Roti and papper  and other flat round bread stuff
Making a gara press for the gara cookies
Snow globe shaker display, shakes every once in awhile
Spinning watch display stand 
Jewelry display box where it is a glass box with water in it and a glass like stand where the glass has the same light refraction as water so it's invisible, this could be used for making a stand for a figure in water and spinning the stand to see a real 360 visibility since the stand will be see through and a go pro could be placed in the water to capture the figure or jewelry
This jewelry box thing can also be a display box with a stand and then the will be the clear glass and will spin via a magnet through the glass like the Lego submarine but the bottom part will be hidden
Facetime feature for magic mirrors maybe, where you can call the other person.
Wood joinery that when i lets say a miter joinery, i carve a hole the shape of a RHN and then put an RHN shaped epoxy from an epoxy mold or a 3D print from a resin printer and use it as a sorta a joinery piece to make sure that the wood stays strong and sorta a watermark or a signature sort of style piece so its like a RHN piece. Of course this would require it to be kinda hidden and make sure it is not too obvious. this would require a jig to make the hole.
Tessellation generator program, that uses the square paper technique and can handle edits to multiple shape tessellations, like squares and rectangles tessellations and can be edited
Tessellations of multiple characters from an IP
Tessellation furniture maybe
Groups of villains figure sets like baroque works or akatsuki or even big mom
A table with inner mechanisms like an infinite loop of say a ball raised to the top of a slide and the ball rolls down the slide. Except the slide is a giant spiral and it deposits balls on a selected frequency. And when they reach the end, the middle of the spiral, it falls down a hole and out the table so they can be re entered this way the table only runs if a ball is in the chamber so to speak. Or it runs on an infinite loop. 
A table with an inner mechanism where it loads balls via a conveyor belt and then releases the balls to initiate a marble race and at the end of the race is the conveyor belt catching more balls to reload the balls. The conveyor belt has a special say hook that will quick release all balls but on a certain frequency depending on the setting of where the hook is
A table with a box in it where there can be a scenery in the giant box and then a glass case over it. Great for supply chains to illustrate the business process and easier to visualize but not perfectly ideal since materials for things like batteries can change so the table will need to be updated.
Making stained glass art in the shapes of polyhedrons and compound polyhedrons. Ex, dodecahedron and icosahedron are cool and even their compound polyhedrons
One taking videos so that they're fast and smooth and even using magic to speed up processes so say like if I'm doing wood working and need to dry some thing then I'll already have the dried version to appear out of nowhere replacing the non dry version that way videos can be done quickly with the speed of edited videos but in one take with dynamic angles that would require a camera man and lots of practise and trial runs. But essentially capturing the magic of that one guy who talked up about a rocket and it went off by the end of his video. Again this is incredibly hard but for sure worth it once there's a team of people around.
Reaching out to firms talking to movie makers about exclusive clips or info and releasing a video about the anticipated media so that people can be interested in it. And are lured with the premise of New knowledge
